# UPES-JAVA
This repository contains solutions to all lab experiments of OOPS lab (UPES CSEG-238). Non-UPESites can practice questions related to Java and refer to solutions.


## What's Included

### [Basic-I](/Basic)

- Write, compile and execute my first java program.
- Write a program to print Fibonacci series using a loop.
- Write a program to find the largest of 3 numbers.
- Write a program to find the sum of all integers greater than 40 and less than 250 that are divisible by 5.

### [Basic-II](/Basic-II)

- Write a program to input a number of a month (1 - 12) and print its equivalent name of the month (e.g 1 to Jan., 2 to Feb., 12 to Dec.)
- Write a program to add two numbers using command line arguments.
- Write a program to implement a command line calculator.
- Write a program to take student information using Scanner class and display output. Use appropriate mutator.
  
### [Objects-and-Methods](/Objects-and-Methods)

- Write a program that demonstrates the working of class, objects and methods.
- Write a program to implement compile-time polymorphism.
- Write a program to implement type promotion in method overloading.
 
### [Inheritance](/Inheritance)

- Write a Java program to show that private members of a super class cannot be accessed from derived classes.
- Write a program in Java to create a Player class. Inherit the classes Cricket _Player, Football _Player and Hockey_ Player from Player class.
- Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. Every worker has a name and a salary rate. Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. A Daily Worker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works. The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate the pay of workers. You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program.
- Design a class employee of an organization. An employee has a name, empid, and salary. Write the default constructor, a constructor with parameters (name, empid, and salary) and methods to return name and salary. Also write a method increaseSalary that raises the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain user specified percentage. Derive a subclass Manager from employee. Supply a test program that uses these classes and methods.
